### Description ###
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module performs several actions on new players. It has the option to give new players BOA starting gear,
additional weapon skills, and special abilities such as custom spells. It can also set the reputation of the player
to exalted with all capital cities for their faction granting them the Ambassador title. This is typically done in
the core's config file, but it's bugged (as of 2017.08.23) in AzerothCore. It can also announce when players login 
or logoff the server.
