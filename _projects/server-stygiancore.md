## GREETINGS

Welcome to StygianCore. This repack is powered by AzerothCore and would not be possible without the players, developers, and communities of the World of Warcraft MMO emulator and private server scene. A big thanks to everyone for any and all contributions absorbed to make this repack possible. Your hard work is much appreciated!

## INTRODUCTION

StygianCore is World of Warcraft v3.3.5a server powered by a modified build of the AzerothCore World of Warcraft v3.3.5a server emulator. It has been providing an enjoyable gaming experience to hundreds of kids at our school since summer of 2017. Last fall I promised to release a repack of this server for parents and students to host at home. Additionally, I wanted to share a fun levelling server for solo or 4-10 player groups and help others who want to get started with development, scripting, and building their own server experience.

Included are custom tools and docs for maintaining the game database and automating archive, save, and restore operations for sandboxing, testing, and development.

In addition to new content, this repack includes updated versions of the modules, SQL, custom tools, and client modifications from my [AzerothCore Content](https://github.com/StygianTheBest/AzerothCore-Content) release in summer 2017.

## DOCUMENTATION & SUPPORT

### This repack is released with _no official support_. All questions, requests, and bug reports should be directed through the [StygianCore GitHub](https://github.com/StygianTheBest) repo(s). Be sure to follow the repos to see when I put out an update or bugfix. I will respond to all questions as time permits.

Documentation for the this repack and its contents can be found throughout the documents, code, SQL, and scripts. For more information you can [visit my website](http://stygianthebest.github.io) or peruse the [GIT](https://github.com/StygianTheBest) repos. I've tried to be as detailed as possible to diminish the learning curve and get new users up and running quickly.

## TOOLS

I've packaged a few custom tools I use for administration of the server. Batch files are used extensively to automate many file handling and database import/export functions. The custom front-end program controls batch files to launch and manage the server processes.

- **StygianCoreControls.exe (SCC)**
  - A server front-end, process monitor, and launcher.
  - Dedicated launch icons for StygianCoreTools and HeidiSQL.
  - Monitors server processes (World, Auth, MySQL, Apache).
  - Restarts crashed processes.
  - Hides running process windows.
  - Gracefully shuts down the database to prevent data loss.
  - Monitors and logs crashes and other system events.

- **StygianCoreTools.bat**
  - This batch file is a UI for game database management.
  - Launch it via a dedicated launch button on the SCC launcher.
  - AzerothCore Sandbox Mode for testing and development.
  - Easy backup, restoration, and testing of game data from backup, archive, or patch.
    - Dynamicly rebuilds restoration archives for quick updates.
    - All backup and archive data is stored in the **Tools/Temp** folder.
    - Selectively backup and restore auth/character or world databases.
    - Auto archives any existing backups when a backup is run.
    - Has error-checking to make sure everyting runs as intended.

- **UpdateDeploy.bat**
  - Included only for reference. Edit the paths to match your system.
  - Launched via StygianCoreTools batch file or start_deploy.bat.
  - Automates testing of different Visual Studio builds on the test server.
  - Supports Debug, RelWithDebInfo, and Release configurations.
  - Supports "Auto Start" after deploying. Great for testing build changes quickly.
  - Extremely useful for Pre/Post Build Events if modified.

- **start_'process'.bat**
  - These are used for customizing the launch of server processes and tools and providing ways to automate tasks from the SCC launcher. There's one for each major process and a few tools.

- **HeidiSQL 9.5 x64 Portable**
  - An excellent free database mangement alternative to NaviCat.
  - Launch it via a dedicated launch button on the SCC launcher.

# GETTING STARTED

This repack includes a default Administrator account. It is used to log into the server console, the WoW game client, and for SOAP communications via the Account Registration portal.

    - Login: admin
    - Password: wow

## 1) ON EACH GAME CLIENT

Set your realmlist.wtf file to point to the server. For local play it should work with 127.0.0.1.

- Locate and edit the WoW client file: **realmlist.wtf**
  - Ex: \<PATH TO WOW>\Data\enUS\realmlist.wtf
- **SET REALMLIST 127.0.0.1**

If you are putting the server on a different system, you will need to use that system's address.
In addition, you will need to edit the auth database to point to that system. In the example, the
server is listening on address 192.168.1.20 and local address 127.0.0.1. Here's a sample query to change the IP.

    INSERT INTO `stygian_auth`.`realmlist` (`id`, `name`, `address`, `localAddress`, `localSubnetMask`, `port`, `icon`, `flag`, `timezone`, `allowedSecurityLevel`, `population`, `gamebuild`) VALUES ('1', 'StygianCore', '192.168.1.20', '127.0.0.1', '255.255.255.0', '8085', '0', '0', '2', '0', '0', '12340');

## 2) UNZIP THE STYGIANCORE REPACK ARCHIVE

This server and tools are portable. You should be able to run it from any folder.

**Recommended Repack Folder: C:\Games\WoW\StygianCore**

## 3) EXECUTE THE TOOLS

### StygianCoreControls.exe - Launcher and Process Monitor

Run StygianCoreControls.exe - This is a launch tool built for StygianCore and assists with running the processes and admin tools in the repack. It is preconfigured to run all of the server components. It controls the following processes:

- Launcher for custom batch files to run StygianCoreTools, HeidiSQL, and others.
- Start/Stop/Restart World, Character, Auth, Web servers
- Track process uptime
- Log server events (Autosave)
- Hide process windows for each server
- Docks to systray with process uptime as balloon text
- Dragons denote the status of each process:
  - Green: Process is running and uptime timer is running
  - Red: Process is not running.
  - Red (Collapsed): Process path not found. Click to set a new path.
  
 This tool comes preconfigured to launch each process batch file, but if you want to change the process or path just click the Dragon icon to bring up the process configuration.

    - WorldServer - start_world.bat
    - AuthServer - start_auth.bat
    - Database - start_database.bat
    - WebServer - start_web.bat
    - HeidiSQL - start_sql.bat
    - DB Tools - StygianCoreTools.bat

### StygianCoreTools.bat - Database Maintenance Tool

This tool handles the archive, backup, and restore processes for StygianCore. When you're ready to perform on of these tasks, click the small 'sword' icon in the bottom right of the launcher to bring up the tool.

- Archives and backups are saved to the Tools\Temp\ folder.
- Archive, backup and restore the world, auth, and character databases.
- Restores the database system to the default state for StygianCore or AzerothCore.
  - Restoring StygianCore will reset the repack to the default state.
  - Sandbox Mode will backup the current server state and restore fresh AzerothCore (master) binaries and database.
    - Exiting Sandbox Mode restores the previously saved game state.
- This is a great option for sandbox testing in-game.

- Allows selective backup and restore for just auth/character or world databases.
- Has error-checking to make sure everything works as intended.
